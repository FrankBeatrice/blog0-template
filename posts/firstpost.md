In response to Life and Death In The Silicon Valley | Louis D. Lo Praeste & Overtime Regulations Disproportionately Harm Young People & Startups | Zachary Slayback I feel the need to express my stance. Time is non-expendable , and should be utilized in a manner of true personal vitality. To quote one cartoonist's brave oxymoron "Tech problems do not exist... people problems exist"

It's about working for a cause...something that is close to your heart. Whether the case is personal development , monetary growth or inspiring innovation. Young innovators and developers give their hours to accomplish something great, something more. If you are not doing something that fulfills some portion of your being , then you are doing life wrong. Working long hours and sacrificing time is to equate to how you feel your time will make a difference. If you can come to the realization that your mission is not safe nor sound and that you may be young, advantageous and slightly impressionable...reevaluate "worth".

Hard work and dedication is meant to mean something. It is not wrong when you are sacrificing yourself for your passion;for what you think will give you meaning or for at-least will lead you to it. It's a choice and not an easy choice at best. It is up to a person to make, to create personal development through an experience. You are never a slave to your labor or abilities unless you allow yourself to be come just that.

Louis D. Lo Praeste & Zachary Slayback both make excellent points in their articles. As an emerging developer I see the valid points both parties address and expand onto. I see more verifiability in Lo Praeste's writing. However, I hope he has not forgotten what it means to be young and advantageous

I myself have personally struggled with stress and the health issues that follow. Personally, I can identify with young tech developers who overwork. I think the main issue is that we as a society have forgotten there exists an in-between. To quote Lo Praeste "Balance, it's always only about balance."
